# PrimateCityCalculator

This is a Python-based program to calculate whether a given city is a primate city based on its population compared to other cities in the country or region. Multiple methods are available to determine the primacy of a city; users can choose between the 2-city population ratio method, the 3-city population ratio method, and Jefferson's Index of Primacy method. 

A primate city is a city that is overwhelmingly dominant in its county or region, either in terms of population, economic activity, or cultural significance, or a combination of all these factors. A commonly used threshold is that the largest city must have more than twice the population of the second largest city to be considered a primate city. That is the threshold this program uses to determine the primacy of a given city, but that is by no means a conclusive or comprehensive method for determining the primacy of a city.
